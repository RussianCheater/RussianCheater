- As you probably guessed, I'm Russian and I like programming
- I started programming very early in life like when I was 9 I did scratch and learned it in about a day while my friends were still struggling.
- I learned lua when I was 10 mainly because I got a PC and started making games in Roblox.
- I learned Python when I was 10 too because my teacher was like "Oh you're a natural! I have a challenge! Go home and learn Python." I went home and learned Python in a day and came back and wrote a whole game just with Python.
- I learned C# when I was 12 because I started doing things in Unity.
- I learned JavaScript when I was 13 because I did things in Minecraft.

- I like programming a lot! :D

- Oh and I like Cyber security too.
